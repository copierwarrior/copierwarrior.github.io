      fact: I was born to serve
      bio: "I have been serving through this industry for over 10 years. My father before me is my mentor and the owner of the business where I sold my first copier, needless to say I have toner running through my blood. It is my goal to know and learn more about each individual business that I serve as I believe in a referral relationship and also knowing more about your solutions to better serve you with mine."
