testimonials:
- name: Dennis Gagnon
  title: Owner, Non-traditional Wealth Management
  quote: I've been working with Dale, and his company for several years. They've always
    met expectations, on an ongoing basis, and have resolved issues in a timely manner.
    I don't expect things to be perfect, but I do expect that when things go wrong,
    that they are fixed as quickly as possible. Dale and his staff have always lived
    up to that expectation. He has never over-promised, and under-delivered as is
    the case with many sales organizations. They offer a lot of value for your hard-earned
    dollar.
