bio: 'I have been serving through this industry for over 10 years. My father before
  me is my mentor and the owner of the business where I sold my first copier, needless
  to say I have toner running through my blood. It is my goal to know and learn more
  about each individual business that I serve as I believe in a referral relationship
  and also knowing more about your solutions to better serve you with mine. I love
  being different from other boring sales people as life is too short not to be yourself
  and have fun. '

testimonials:
- name: Dennis Gagnon
  quote: I've been working with Dale, and his company for several years. They've always
    met expectations, on an ongoing basis, and have resolved issues in a timely manner.
    I don't expect things to be perfect, but I do expect that when things go wrong,
    that they are fixed as quickly as possible. Dale and his staff have always lived
    up to that expectation. He has never over-promised, and under-delivered as is
    the case with many sales organizations. They offer a lot of value for your hard-earned
    dollar.
  title: Owner, Non-traditional Wealth Management
- name: Kathy Clinton
  quote: Dale is very knowledgeable about the products he offers and how they can
    be used to make your business more efficient. Dale has given me very good advice
    concerning our processes at our non-profit agency. He truly cares about our community
    and is anxious to help in any way he can.
  title: Executive Director at Hidden Potentials, Inc.
- name: Ray Bazzi
  quote: I am very impressed with Dale's great ability to consult with companies to
    determine the best and most cost effective solution when it comes to copiers.
    Dale is professional, knowledgeable, and most importantly makes doing business
    with him easy and fun.
